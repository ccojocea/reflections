Set your details
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john@example.com"
Use --global to set the configuration for all projects. If git config is used without --global and run inside a project directory, the settings are set for the specific project.

See your settings
git config --list

Initialize a git repository for existing code
cd existing-project/
git init

Clone a remote repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
This creates a new directory with the name of the repository.

Update and merge your current branch with a remote
cd repository/
git pull origin master
Where origin is the remote repository, and master the remote branch.
If you don't want to merge your changes, use git fetch

View remote urls
git remote -v

Change origin url
git remote set-url origin http//github.com/repo.git

Add remote
git remote add remote-name https://github.com/user/repo.git

See details (log message, text diff) of a commit
git show COMMIT_ID

Make some changes, commit them
git add changed_file.txt
git add folder-with-changed-files/
git commit -m "Commiting changes"

Change message of last commit
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

Push local commits to remote branch
git push origin master
See recent commit history
git log
See commit history for the last two commits
git log -2
See commit history for the last two commits, with diff
git log -p -2
See commit history printed in single lines
git log --pretty=oneline
Revert one commit, push it
git revert dd61ab21
git push origin master
Revert to the moment before one commit
# reset the index to the desired tree
git reset 56e05fced

# move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}

git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"

# Update working copy to reflect the new commit
git reset --hard

Undo last commit, preserving local changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
Undo last commit, without preserving local changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
Undo last commit, preserving local changes in index
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
Or git reset HEAD~1
See also http://stackoverflow.com/q/927358/1391963

Undo non-pushed commits
git reset origin/master
Reset to remote state
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
See local branches
git branch
See all branches
git branch -a
Make some changes, create a patch
git diff > patch-issue-1.patch
Add a file and create a patch
git add newfile
git diff --staged > patch-issue-2.patch
Add a file, make some changes, and create a patch
git add newfile
git diff HEAD > patch-issue-2.patch
Make a patch for a commit
git format-patch COMMIT_ID
Make patches for the last two commits
git format-patch HEAD~2
Make patches for all non-pushed commits
git format-patch origin/master
Create patches that contain binary content
git format-patch --binary --full-index origin/master
Apply a patch
git apply -v patch-name.patch
Apply a patch created using format-patch
git am patch1.patch
Create a tag
git tag 7.x-1.3
Push a tag
git push origin 7.x-1.3
Create a branch
git checkout master
git branch new-branch-name
Here master is the starting point for the new branch. Note that with these 2 commands we don't move to the new branch, as we are still in master and we would need to run git checkout new-branch-name. The same can be achieved using one single command: git checkout -b new-branch-name

Create a branch from a previous commit
git branch branchname 
or using a symbolic reference (e.g. last commit):

git branch branchname HEAD~1
You can also use

git checkout -b branchname 
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2816728/1391963

Checkout a branch
git checkout new-branch-name
See commit history for just the current branch
git cherry -v master
(master is the branch you want to compare)

Merge branch commits
git checkout master
git merge branch-name
Here we are merging all commits of branch-name to master.

Merge a branch without committing
git merge branch-name --no-commit --no-ff
See differences between the current state and a branch
git diff branch-name
See differences in a file, between the current state and a branch
git diff branch-name path/to/file
Delete a branch
git branch -d new-branch-name
Push the new branch
git push origin new-branch-name
Get all branches
git fetch origin
Get the git root directory
git rev-parse --show-toplevel

Remove from repository all locally deleted files
git rm $(git ls-files --deleted)
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5147119/1391963

Delete all untracked files
git clean -f
Including directories:

git clean -f -d
Preventing sudden cardiac arrest:

git clean -n -f -d

Delete all files from a git repository that have already been deleted from disk:
git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs -0 git rm

Show total file size difference between two commits
Short answer: Git does not do that.
Long answer: See http://stackoverflow.com/a/10847242/1391963

Unstage (undo add) files:
git reset HEAD file.txt
See closest tag
git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
Source. See also git-describe.

Have git pull running every X seconds, with GNU Screen
screen
for((i=1;i<=10000;i+=1)); do sleep 30 && git pull; done
Use Ctrl+a Ctrl+d to detach the screen.

See previous git commands executed
history | grep git
or

grep '^git'  /root/.bash_history

Tar project files, excluding .git directory
cd ..
tar cJf project.tar.xz project/ --exclude-vcs
Tar all locally modified files
git diff --name-only | xargs tar -cf project.tar -T -
Look for conflicts in your current files
grep -H -r "<<<" *
grep -H -r ">>>" *
grep -H -r '^=======$' *
There's also git-grep.

Apply a patch not using git:
patch -p1 < file.patch

 git diff --staged (compares staging area to repository most recent commit)
 
 git log --graph --oneline master_branch other_branch (replace with whatever)
 git log --graph --oneline (can be used to see branches after merge)

 git show commit_id (show diff between this newer commit id and its parent, without knowing the parent)
 
 git merge branch_name (while being sure we're on checkout branch_to_be_merged_with)
 git merge --abort (in case of errors while we merge, abort to fix errors)

 git remote
 git remote add origin url
 git remote -v (verbose - more information)
 
 git push origin master (origin being the remote, master being the branch I want to push)
 git push origin different-branch
 git pull origin master
 
 git fetch origin - update all of the local copies of every branch for the origin remote
 git pull origin master = git fetch origin + git merge origin/master (while on master)
